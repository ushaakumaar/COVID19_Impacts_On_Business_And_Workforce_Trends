# About
***

COVID-19 has been one of the most unpredictable and transformative pandemics in recorded history. It has been overwhelming because most businesses could not sustain and many people lost their jobs. So, our team decided to study the overall impacts of this pandemic on various businesses and workforce trends in the US. 

This project analyzes COVID-19-related business trends through detailed assessment of unemployment rates, economic fluctuations, and factors (e.g., demographics, travel, personal habits) that likely contribute to growth and/or contraction in the US during the worldwide pandemic. Correlations and associations between various factors and increased downturn clearly point to certain consistent vulnerabilities.

# Questions Analyzed
***

COVID-19 impacts and the questions we wanted to analyze as part of this project:
* **Unemployment** - Which ethnic group, industry and states had the highest and lowest unemployment rates during the pandemic?
* **Businesses** - Which businesses economically benefitted or lost the most due to COVID-19?
* **Airlines & Travel Routes** - Which airlines and travel routes were most affected during the pandemic?
* **Mobility Trends** - Is there any relationship between the total COVID-19 cases and mobility trends (i.e., people staying at home) in the US?
* **Safest Travel Destination** In the current situation, which is the safest travel destination in the US right now?

# Data Source
***

* **Unemployment**
    - [Unemployment Rates for various Races](https://beta.bls.gov/dataQuery/find?st=0&r=20&q=unemployment&more=0&fq=cg:[Unemployment+and+Labor+Force+Status])
    - [Unemployment Rates for various Industries](https://beta.bls.gov/dataQuery/find?st=0&r=20&q=unemployment&more=0&fq=cg:[Establishments%2FBusinesses%2FFirms])
    - [Unemployment Rates for all US States](https://beta.bls.gov/dataQuery/find?st=0&r=20&q=unemployment&more=0&fq=cg:[Geography])

* **Businesses**
    - [Jupyter Notebook Script](https://github.com/ushaakumaar/Python-Project-1/blob/main/business-stock-retrieval.ipynb) was written based on the python script available in [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jacksoncrow/download-nasdaq-historical-data) to retrieve all NASDAQ traded stock prices on 2019/12/31(Pre COVID), 2020/03/31, 2020/06/30 and 2020/10/09 into a CSV file for further analysis.

* **Airlines & Travel Routes**
    - [US Airlines Flight Delays and Cancellations Data](https://www.kaggle.com/akulbahl/covid19-airline-flight-delays-and-cancellations)

* **Mobility Trends**
    - [US Mobility _(Population staying at home)_ Data](https://data.bts.gov/)
    - [US National Level COVID data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us.csv)

* **Safest Travel Destination**
    - [US County Level Population Data](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/tables/2010-2019/counties/totals/co-est2019-annres-06.xlsx)

# Data Analysis Process
***
The project collects data from multiple sources cited above, performs normalization and aggregations thereafter, and based on the data, generates various plots/maps to analyze and determine useful insights and draw conclusions to answer the questions.

## Data Clean Up and Data Wrangling

Following data clean up, wrangling steps were performed wherever required and the cleaned and transformed data was used for the remaining steps.

* Data was cleaned up removing NaNs/duplicates
* Data was converted to appropriate data types
* Data from multiple sources were merged to one dataset that could be used for remaining steps

## Summary Statistics

* **Unemployment**
    - US States that were most affected (or) less affected due to the pandemic were chosen to generate the plot

* **Businesses**
    - Percentage of change in stock price for each specified time period was calculated
    - Top 10 and Bottom 10 performing businesses were determined

* **Airlines & Travel Routes**
    - Route that has maximum cancellations was determined
    - Route that has maximum delays was determined
    - Airline that has maximum cancellations was determined
    - Airline that has maximum delays was determined

* **Safest Travel Destination**
    - Top 15 Safest travel destinations at County Level in US was determined
